Copy "program.svg" to the same directory that the compiled JASL program (jasl.exe) is located. Now when JASL compiles a program, the binary  gridmap for that program will be written to program.svg. JASL does not currently have the ability to write to separate SVG files. You only need to copy "program.svg" one time, not every time you compile -- JASL will overwrite program.svg as needed.
